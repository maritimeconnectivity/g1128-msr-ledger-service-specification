# How to embed .drawio file?

Unfortunately there is no support for automatically building an image to be embedded at the time of a commit. So you need to export an image before embedding it.

When you want to make an update of a figure, click *File -> export as -> PNG* from menu of draw.io and press *Export* and then pick a place where you want to store it.

You can directly make a commit if you choose GitHub and this folder in MSR-WG repository.
